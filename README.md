# week3project

A readme.md file which must include:  

A description of the problem domain your team is tentatively wanting to focus on in the project. (e.g., trivia, finance, real estate, etc…)  

A brief, high-level description of what kind of application your team is thinking of developing.  

Our team is thinking of developing an application that can store recipes, and let users add recipes of their own. The 
application would allow the user to search for recipes using a specific ingredient, or by specific nutritional content (ex. protein, vitamins, etc.).
In addition, the user would be able to add recipes to a collection, which could function like a daily meal plan and allow
the user to see the total nutritional value of all the included recipes. Given the meal plan, our application would then be
able to generate a shopping list based on the ingredients in each recipe.

This is mostly just so we can give you some initial feedback on whether your team might want to reconsider your project direction.  

A link to the documentation for an API your team can use related to the domain.  

https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api    

A screenshot of using a tool to try out the API (like https://www.postman.com/ or https://hoppscotch.io)  

It is an attempt to search for recipes that contain "beef".

example output of running your Java code (see below).  

A list of any technical problems blocking progress (if any)
please don't hesitate to ask such questions on Piazza too of course.  

Java code:  

A minimal example of calling the API from Java.  

The output of the program should indicate the result of the request.  

Tools like those above will generate code snippets for you, as will some API documentation pages. You can also refer to the code from the Grade API lab activity for examples using OkHttp.
