#### Problem domain
The problem domain our team plans to focus on is a recipe organizer.

#### Description of application your team is thinking of developing.  

Our team is thinking of developing an application that can store recipes, and let users add recipes of their own. The 
application would allow the user to search for recipes using a specific ingredient, or by specific nutritional content (ex. protein, vitamins, etc.).
In addition, the user would be able to add recipes to a collection, which could function like a daily meal plan and allow
the user to see the total nutritional value of all the included recipes. Given the meal plan, our application would then be
able to generate a shopping list based on the ingredients in each recipe.

#### A link to the documentation for a related API.

#### A screenshot of using a tool to try out the API 

It is an attempt to search for recipes that contain "beef".

An example output of running your Java code (see below).  


Java code:  

A minimal example of calling the API from Java.  

The output of the program should indicate the result of the request.  

Tools like those above will generate code snippets for you, as will some API documentation pages. You can also refer to the code from the Grade API lab activity for examples using OkHttp.
